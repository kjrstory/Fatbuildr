# The systemd package installed in Debian sid OSI image runs systemd-sysusers in
#Â its deb postinst scripts with its own sysusers.d/*.conf files in arguments.
# This makes systemd-sysusers ignoring the sysusers.d/fatbuildr.conf file
# installed by mkosi skeleton with its explicit UID/GID (to match the host) and
# it could potentially create systemd users and groups with conflicting UID/GID.
# The solution in this postinstall script is to remove possible conflicting user
# and group with the required UID/GID and rerun systemd-sysusers without
# arguments to create all the missing stuff.
