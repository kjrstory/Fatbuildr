= Tasks Hooks

Fatbuildr can execute any arbitrary program (script or a binary file) as a hook
when tasks are started and terminated. This can typically be used to notify
teams (with Matrix, Slack or similar) or trigger any synchronization or
deployment system.

== Configuration

To enable tasks hook, define the `hook` parameter in `[tasks]` section of
xref:conf.adoc[system configuration file]. For example:

[source,ini]
----
[tasks]
hook = /path/to/program
----

The destination of the path must be executable by `fatbuildr` system user, or a
symbolic link to a file that is executable by this user.

== Environments Variables

When Fatbuildr executes the hook program, it defines multiple environment
variables to provide some context:

* `FATBUILDR_INSTANCE_ID`: The unique identifier of the instance.
* `FATBUILDR_INSTANCE_NAME`: The full text name of the
  xref:instances.adoc[instance], as defined in its pipeline definition.
* `FATBUILDR_TASK_ID`: The unique identifier of the task.
* `FATBUILDR_TASK_NAME`: The name of the task (ex: _artifact build_)
* `FATBUILDR_TASK_METADATA`: base64 encoded representation of task metadata
  serialized in JSON format.
* `FATBUILDR_TASK_STAGE`: String value (_start_ or _end_) to determine if the
  task is respectively starting or terminating.
* `FATBUILDR_TASK_RESULT`: The result of the task. The value is _unknown_ when
  task is starting, it can be _failed_ or _success_ when task is terminated.

These environment variables can be used to implement some logic in the hook
program.

== Examples

Fatbuildr includes two examples of tasks hooks. The following subsections
describe their purpose with an installation procedure.

=== Syslog Message

The first example of tasks hook included in Fatbuildr packages is available
under the path [.path]#`/usr/share/doc/fatbuildr/examples/fatbuildr-syslog`#.
This is a really basic Python script that sends text message in syslog.

This script can be installed with this command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo cp /usr/share/doc/fatbuildr/examples/fatbuildr-syslog \
  /usr/local/lib/fatbuildr/fatbuildr-syslog
----

Then set `hook` parameter in xref:conf.adoc[system configuration file]
`/etc/fatbuildr/fatbuildr.ini`:

[source,ini]
----
[tasks]
hook = /usr/local/lib/fatbuildr/fatbuildr-syslog
----

This hook script send these messages to syslog:

----
fatbuildr-hook: fatbuildr-hook task b84787a2-0f56-4c60-8e3d-a035c8e601eb@default is starting
fatbuildr-hook: fatbuildr-hook task b84787a2-0f56-4c60-8e3d-a035c8e601eb@default is terminated: success
fatbuildr-hook: fatbuildr-hook task 661beead-96c4-410c-a9c4-260d350a92c3@default is starting
fatbuildr-hook: fatbuildr-hook task 661beead-96c4-410c-a9c4-260d350a92c3@default is terminated: success
----

=== Matrix Notifications

The second example of tasks hook included in Fatbuildr packages is available
under the path
[.path]#`/usr/share/doc/fatbuildr/examples/hooks/fatbuildr-matrix-notify`#.
This is a Python script designed to send custom notification to
https://matrix.org/[Matrix chats rooms].

It can be installed with this command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo cp /usr/share/doc/fatbuildr/examples/hooks/fatbuildr-matrix-notify \
  /usr/local/lib/fatbuildr/fatbuildr-matrix-notify
----

The script depends on https://pypi.org/project/nio/[Python _nio_ library] which
can be installed with this command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install python3-matrix-nio
----

Create configuration file `/etc/fatbuildr/matrix-hook.json` with the settings to
access Matrix room:

[source,json]
----
{
  "homeserver": "https://matrix.example.com",
  "user_id": "@user:matrix.example.com",
  "device_name": "fatbuildr-bot",
  "password": "SECR3T PASSWORD",
  "room_id": "!room_id:matrix.example.com",
  "url": "https://build.example.com",
}
----

Notifications messages sent to Matrix rooms are generated based on templates.
Install these templates with these commands:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo mkdir /etc/fatbuildr/matrix-hook
$ sudo cp -r /usr/share/doc/fatbuildr/examples/hooks/templates /etc/fatbuildr/matrix-hook/
----

NOTE: These templates can be modified to customize the content and layout of the
notification messages.

Finally, enable hook in xref:conf.adoc[system configuration file]
`/etc/fatbuildr/fatbuildr.ini`:

[source,ini]
----
[tasks]
hook = /usr/local/lib/fatbuildr/fatbuildr-matrix-notify
----

This screenshot shows some examples of notification messages sent by this script
in a Matrix room:
