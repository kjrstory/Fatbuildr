= Continuous Develivery

Continuous delivery is in the middle of CI/CD pipeline: after unit tests
validation (CI), it is responsible of building the artifacts and perform
essential system integration tests, ready for deployment (CD).

Continuous integration ensures software components work atomically, that all
individual parts of the software produce expected results. However, unit tests
do not test the software works in all supported heterogenous ecosystem, with
different versions of OS distributions bundled with their specific stack of
libraries and tools.

Continuous delivery platforms provide solution to build and publish software
artifacts for many software ecosystem and perform advanced system integration
tests to secure deployments in heterogenous production environments.
