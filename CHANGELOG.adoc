== {unreleased}[Unreleased]

=== Added
* docs:
** Add large Fatbuildr logos intended for docs.rackslab.io landing page
** Add Release notes page based on `CHANGELOG.adoc`
* conf: add `env_as_root` boolean parameter in `format:{deb,rpm}` section to
  control if commands to create and update build environments are executed as
  root super-user or the user running `fatbuildrd` daemon.
* pkgs: add `CHANGELOG.adoc` in {deb,rpm} packages
* templates: add `gittag` filter which is notably useful to transform version

=== Fixed
* pkgs: remove useless symbolic link in prescript
* cli:
** Avoid catching unwanted `AttributeError` exceptions while checking for action

  `/registry`) when Fatbuildrweb is executed in mono-instance mode.
